Infrastructure: Implemented a 5-node banking network segmented into Edge (ATM, Mobile), Internal (Teller), and Core (Database, SWIFT) zones.

Incident Summary: The system successfully detected and logged multiple high-intensity attack vectors.

DDoS: Successfully breached the Edge layer (ATM_1 and Mobile_Gateway).

Ransomware: Successfully bypassed Core defenses, resulting in a breach of the Core_DB.

2. Defense Allocation & Optimization (Part 3)
==================================================================

Budget Management: Started with a $2000 allocation.

Spending: $400 was deployed to increase security levels on weak nodes.

Remaining Capital: $1600 retained for recovery operations.

3. Compliance & Governance (Part 6 & 7)
===================================================================
Audit Trail: A tamper-proof final_audit.json has been generated, capturing every attack and defense transaction.

Deployment: The platform is fully operational via a Streamlit SOC Dashboard, allowing for real-time risk monitoring.
